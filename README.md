# PACT Lab

PACT Lab is a research-driven behavioural experimentation platform inspired by the philosophy of running temporary, structured experiments instead of rigid long-term goals.

The system focuses on:
- Curiosity over discipline
- Insight over streaks
- Sustainability over performance

## Core Idea

Users create time-bound behavioural experiments (“Pacts”) and log:

- Completion
- Energy level
- Emotional state
- Short reflections

The system then computes a **Behaviour Sustainability Score** using:

- Completion consistency
- Energy trend
- Sustainability balance (energy vs completion correlation)
- Emotional signal

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Java + Spring Boot
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Mobile: Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Deployment: TBD (initial MVP deployment planned)

## Roadmap

- [ ] MVP backend
- [ ] Pact creation
- [ ] Daily check-in system
- [ ] Insight engine (v1 scoring model)
- [ ] AI reflection analysis
- [ ] Public beta
