# Vision

PACT Lab replaces rigid goal-setting with structured behavioural experiments.

The objective is to create a system that detects behavioural sustainability by modelling:

- Completion consistency
- Energy correlation
- Emotional signals

The product is intentionally designed to avoid streak anxiety and performance pressure.
